## TODOs

#### TODO

- rewrite `build_and_run.sh` as an launcher for `apex`
- maybe we should compute path on the instruction level

- find multiple paths from source to target, not only one
- check if target function is reachable before finding path
- add sanity check for user input (e.g. non-existent functions)
- remove junk code
